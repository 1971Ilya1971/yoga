- Countdown timer;
- Modal windows;
- Sending form (using **FormData, JSON, AJAX**);
- Using ES6 **Promises**;
- Slider;
- Cost calculator.

## Demo 🎥

## How to Use 🔧

***Running a project locally*** 🚀

If you wish to run project locally as is, then all that's required is the `css`, `js`, `icons`, `img`, `logo` folders and the `index.html`, `server.php` files from this repository. Then just need to open `index.html`.

***Prerequisites*** 📋

But this way you can't see the result of sending data from the form to server.php therefore, it is recommended to use a local server (for example, Open Server) to demonstrate this functionality.

## Features

All JavaScript functions are well described in the [file](js/script.js) itself.
